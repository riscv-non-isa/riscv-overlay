== General summary
* We will keep the meeting on the same time slot:
*_Wednesday 6:00 am PST/2 pm UK/4 pm ISR/10 pm China_*
* After HLD review will be complete we will start working on publish patches
to llvm and GNU.

== Action items
* 2.7.1.5 add bullets
* 2.7.2 elaborate that *ovlinput* are sections arrived from *overlay attribute*?
* 2.7.2.1 /2 mention that linker autogrouping is the default and that grouping
file and external tool are optional.Using both a grouping file and grouping tool
is an error.
* 2.7.2.2
** add dot to *ovlgrps*
** fix bullets
** add 'dot' to *ovlchache*
** mention that *debug info* it should go into this section. On Debug chapter
we will elaborate more.
* 2.7.2.3
** add 'dot' to *ovlplt* and move it to 2.7.2.2
** add a cross-link to the syntax of the tables + explain again that it
goes to group -1-
* 2.7.2.4 add a cross-link to the *token table*
* 2.7.2.5
** add cross ref to group structure
** flag to activate the creation of CRC checksum on linker side
** let us state the chosen CRC algo (just pick one)
** We need better names for MIN/MAX_GROUP_SIZE, and we need to align it with the
draft.

* Check if we had crc32 hook on the hook section. If missing, we should add it.
** *[OS]*: The CRC is not part of the *HLD* same as all hooks. They are part of
the implementation (*LLD*). On the _riscv-overlay-software-standard-draft.adoc_
we only specified the *must* have hooks. CRC hook is an optional per-application
design.



== Open issue / Open discussion
* Section 2.5:
** We need to check with eABI-TG if there are plans regarding TP register.
From what we know, it's not been used by any small RTOS, but maybe we miss
something, or there are plans for it.


== Still pending:
* Inputs from Michael E. the current concept is based on the relative between
the "storage" and the "heap", can we think of a different approach of "altering"
symbols on runtime so they won't be relative to the heap?

** The question related to how code that references absolute addresses could be
handled while avoiding having to rewrite addresses at runtime.

** Without seeing the use case, it is assumed that this relates to some code
that jumps to or loads from an absolute address, but that absolute address
is in an overlay.



== Next
* Start to review the Toolchain HLD - Debug
